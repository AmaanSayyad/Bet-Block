## BetBlock

One of our team-mate was on etherscan exploring some transactions and saw an advertisement of [https://stake.com/](url) which was giving 200% bonus on first deposit, when our team-mate deposited the 120 USDT into this platform they gave him 360 USDT as total balance and when our teammate started playing game he was shocked to see that he was only able to play with $1 per game of Play Plinko Online - Pachinko Casino Game on Stake.com and was unable to increase the betting amount beyond $1 coz he was using the bonus scheme of 200% and when he tried to explore and play other games on the platform he got to know that this platform has cheated him under the name of wager limits.

When he tried to withdraw money they showed him this rule list of wager limit which said that if he wants to withdraw the deposited amount then he have to play $12,300 worth of game play and this was the big shock for him where he was explained a maths logic by their live support. Thereby, In the hope of getting the deposited money back he played the game Plinko entire night and lost all money.
